# Minesweeper_AngererJannick

This is the game called Minesweeper. In this game you
 * have a grid with a certain number of grids. There a
 * 3 basic sizes:
 *      -8x8 (Beginner)
 *      -16x16 (Medium)
 *      -20x20 (Advanced)
 * This game is all about not clicking on a bomb, which isnt
 * even that easy, because at the start every field needs
 * to be uncovered. But if you uncover every field without
 * touching a bomb you win, but if you do touch a bomb you
 * lose! To remember where a bomb is, you have a certain amount
 * of flags, which can be used to mark bombs, but you only have
 * as many flags as there are bombs on the field
